Uses of Queue in java.util Subinterfaces of Queue in java.util Modifier and Type Interface and Description interface Deque<E> A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. Classes in java.util that implement Queue Modifier and Type Class and Description class AbstractQueue<E> This class provides skeletal implementations of some Queue operations. class ArrayDeque<E> Resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface. class LinkedList<E> Doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. class PriorityQueue<E> An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap. Methods in java.util that return Queue Modifier and Type Method and Description static <T> Queue<T> Collections.asLifoQueue(Deque<T> deque) Returns a view of a Deque as a Last-in-first-out (Lifo) Queue. Uses of Queue in java.util.concurrent Subinterfaces of Queue in java.util.concurrent Modifier and Type Interface and Description interface BlockingDeque<E> A Deque that additionally supports blocking operations that wait for the deque to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available in the deque when storing an element. interface BlockingQueue<E> A Queue that additionally supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element. interface TransferQueue<E> A BlockingQueue in which producers may wait for consumers to receive elements. Classes in java.util.concurrent that implement Queue Modifier and Type Class and Description class ArrayBlockingQueue<E> A bounded blocking queue backed by an array. class ConcurrentLinkedDeque<E> An unbounded concurrent deque based on linked nodes. class ConcurrentLinkedQueue<E> An unbounded thread-safe queue based on linked nodes. class DelayQueue<E extends Delayed> An unbounded blocking queue of Delayed elements, in which an element can only be taken when its delay has expired. class LinkedBlockingDeque<E> An optionally-bounded blocking deque based on linked nodes. class LinkedBlockingQueue<E> An optionally-bounded blocking queue based on linked nodes. class LinkedTransferQueue<E> An unbounded TransferQueue based on linked nodes. class PriorityBlockingQueue<E> An unbounded blocking queue that uses the same ordering rules as class PriorityQueue and supplies blocking retrieval operations. class SynchronousQueue<E> A blocking queue in which each insert operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another thread, and vice versa.

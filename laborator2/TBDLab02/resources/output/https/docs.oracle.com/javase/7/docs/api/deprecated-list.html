Its functionality has been replaced by java.security.KeyStore, the java.security.cert package, and java.security.Principal. java.io.LineNumberInputStream This class incorrectly assumes that bytes adequately represent characters. As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to operate on character streams is via the new character-stream classes, which include a class for counting line numbers. java.rmi.server.LogStream no replacement javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalComboBoxUI.MetalComboPopup As of Java 2 platform v1.4. java.rmi.server.Operation no replacement org.xml.sax.helpers.ParserFactory This class works with the deprecated Parser interface. javax.security.auth.Policy as of JDK version 1.4 -- Replaced by java.security.Policy. java.security.Policy has a method:       public PermissionCollection getPermissions
          (java.security.ProtectionDomain pd)

 and ProtectionDomain has a constructor:       public ProtectionDomain
          (CodeSource cs,
           PermissionCollection permissions,
           ClassLoader loader,
           Principal[] principals)
 These two APIs provide callers the means to query the Policy for Principal-based Permission entries. org.omg.CORBA.Principal Deprecated by CORBA 2.2. org.omg.CORBA.PrincipalHolder Deprecated by CORBA 2.2. java.security.Signer This class is no longer used. Its functionality has been replaced by java.security.KeyStore, the java.security.cert package, and java.security.Principal. javax.xml.soap.SOAPElementFactory - Use javax.xml.soap.SOAPFactory for creating SOAPElements. java.io.StringBufferInputStream This class does not properly convert characters into bytes.

Any monitors it held would have remained locked. However, the method was never implemented. If if were to be implemented, it would be deadlock-prone in much the manner of Thread.suspend(). If the target thread held a lock protecting a critical system resource when it was destroyed, no thread could ever access this resource again. If another thread ever attempted to lock this resource, deadlock would result. Such deadlocks typically manifest themselves as "frozen" processes.

See Thread.suspend() for details. java.lang.Thread.resume() This method exists solely for use with Thread.suspend(), which has been deprecated because it is deadlock-prone. For more information, see Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?. java.lang.System.runFinalizersOnExit(boolean) This method is inherently unsafe. It may result in finalizers being called on live objects while other threads are concurrently manipulating those objects, resulting in erratic behavior or deadlock. java.lang.Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit(boolean) This method is inherently unsafe. It may result in finalizers being called on live objects while other threads are concurrently manipulating those objects, resulting in erratic behavior or deadlock. java.util.Properties.save(OutputStream, String) This method does not throw an IOException if an I/O error occurs while saving the property list.

The MBean Server used to obtain an attribute value is QueryEval.getMBeanServer(). javax.swing.JRootPane.setMenuBar(JMenuBar) As of Swing version 1.0.3 replaced by setJMenuBar(JMenuBar menu). javax.swing.JInternalFrame.setMenuBar(JMenuBar) As of Swing version 1.0.3 replaced by setJMenuBar(JMenuBar m). java.sql.Date.setMinutes(int) java.util.Date.setMinutes(int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, int minutes). java.awt.event.KeyEvent.setModifiers(int) as of JDK1.1.4 java.sql.Time.setMonth(int) java.util.Date.setMonth(int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, int month). java.awt.List.setMultipleSelections(boolean) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by setMultipleMode(boolean). javax.swing.JComponent.setNextFocusableComponent(Component) As of 1.4, replaced by FocusTraversalPolicy javax.management.monitor.MonitorMBean.setObservedObject(ObjectName) As of JMX 1.2, replaced by MonitorMBean.addObservedObject(javax.management.ObjectName) javax.management.monitor.Monitor.setObservedObject(ObjectName) As of JMX 1.2, replaced by Monitor.addObservedObject(javax.management.ObjectName) java.rmi.server.LogStream.setOutputStream(OutputStream) no replacement java.awt.Scrollbar.setPageIncrement(int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by setBlockIncrement(). java.security.Signature.setParameter(String, Object) Use setParameter. javax.xml.bind.Validator.setProperty(String, Object) since JAXB2.0 java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.setRef(RemoteStub, RemoteRef) no replacement. The setRef method is not needed since RemoteStubs can be created with the RemoteStub(RemoteRef) constructor. java.sql.Date.setSeconds(int) java.util.Date.setSeconds(int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, int seconds). javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean.setThreshold(Number) As of JMX 1.2, replaced by CounterMonitorMBean.setInitThreshold(java.lang.Number) javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor.setThreshold(Number) As of JMX 1.2, replaced by CounterMonitor.setInitThreshold(java.lang.Number) java.net.DatagramSocketImpl.setTTL(byte) use setTimeToLive instead. java.net.MulticastSocket.setTTL(byte) use the setTimeToLive method instead, which uses int instead of byte as the type for ttl. java.sql.PreparedStatement.setUnicodeStream(int, InputStream, int) javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet.setUnicodeStream(int, InputStream, int) getCharacterStream should be used in its place java.net.URLStreamHandler.setURL(URL, String, String, int, String, String) Use setURL(URL, String, String, int, String, String, String, String); javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller.setValidating(boolean) since JAXB2.0, please see Unmarshaller.setSchema(javax.xml.validation.Schema) java.sql.Time.setYear(int) java.util.Date.setYear(int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year + 1900). java.awt.Dialog.show() As of JDK version 1.5, replaced by setVisible(boolean). java.awt.Component.show() As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by setVisible(boolean). java.awt.Window.show() As of JDK version 1.5, replaced by Window.setVisible(boolean). java.awt.Component.show(boolean) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by setVisible(boolean). java.awt.Component.size() As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by getSize(). javax.swing.JTable.sizeColumnsToFit(boolean) As of Swing version 1.0.3, replaced by doLayout(). java.lang.ThreadGroup.stop() This method is inherently unsafe. See Thread.stop() for details. java.lang.Thread.stop() This method is inherently unsafe. Stopping a thread with Thread.stop causes it to unlock all of the monitors that it has locked (as a natural consequence of the unchecked ThreadDeath exception propagating up the stack). If any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in an inconsistent state, the damaged objects become visible to other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior. Many uses of stop should be replaced by code that simply modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should stop running. The target thread should check this variable regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion if the variable indicates that it is to stop running. If the target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable, for example), the interrupt method should be used to interrupt the wait. For more information, see Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?. java.lang.Thread.stop(Throwable) This method is inherently unsafe. See Thread.stop() for details. An additional danger of this method is that it may be used to generate exceptions that the target thread is unprepared to handle (including checked exceptions that the thread could not possibly throw, were it not for this method). For more information, see Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?. java.lang.ThreadGroup.suspend() This method is inherently deadlock-prone. See Thread.suspend() for details. java.lang.Thread.suspend() This method has been deprecated, as it is inherently deadlock-prone. If the target thread holds a lock on the monitor protecting a critical system resource when it is suspended, no thread can access this resource until the target thread is resumed. If the thread that would resume the target thread attempts to lock this monitor prior to calling resume, deadlock results. Such deadlocks typically manifest themselves as "frozen" processes. For more information, see Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?. java.util.Date.toGMTString() As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by DateFormat.format(Date date), using a GMT TimeZone. java.util.Date.toLocaleString() As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by DateFormat.format(Date date). java.rmi.server.Operation.toString() no replacement java.rmi.server.LogStream.toString() no replacement java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(int) This method does not properly convert bytes into characters. As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the toString(String enc) method, which takes an encoding-name argument, or the toString() method, which uses the platform's default character encoding. java.io.File.toURL() This method does not automatically escape characters that are illegal in URLs. It is recommended that new code convert an abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the toURI method, and then converting the URI into a URL via the URI.toURL method. javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalScrollPaneUI.uninstallListeners(JScrollPane) - Replaced by MetalScrollPaneUI.uninstallListeners(JComponent) java.util.Date.UTC(int, int, int, int, int, int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec) or GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec), using a UTC TimeZone, followed by Calendar.getTime().getTime(). javax.xml.bind.Validator.validate(Object) since JAXB2.0 javax.xml.bind.Validator.validateRoot(Object) since JAXB2.0 javax.swing.text.View.viewToModel(float, float, Shape) org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream.write_Principal(Principal) Deprecated by CORBA 2.2. java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(byte[], int, int) no replacement java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(int) no replacement java.io.ObjectOutputStream.PutField.write(ObjectOutput) This method does not write the values contained by this PutField object in a proper format, and may result in corruption of the serialization stream. The correct way to write PutField data is by calling the ObjectOutputStream.writeFields() method. Deprecated Constructors Constructor and Description javax.management.AttributeValueExp() An instance created with this constructor cannot be used in a query. java.sql.Date(int, int, int) instead use the constructor Date(long date) java.util.Date(int, int, int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date) or GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date). java.util.Date(int, int, int, int, int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min) or GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min). java.util.Date(int, int, int, int, int, int) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec) or GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec). java.util.Date(String) As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by DateFormat.parse(String s). java.awt.event.KeyEvent(Component, int, long, int, int) as of JDK1.1 java.rmi.server.Operation(String) no replacement java.rmi.RMISecurityException(String) no replacement java.rmi.RMISecurityException(String, String) no replacement java.rmi.ServerRuntimeException(String, Exception) no replacement java.rmi.server.SkeletonMismatchException(String) no replacement java.net.Socket(InetAddress, int, boolean) Use DatagramSocket instead for UDP transport. java.net.Socket(String, int, boolean) Use DatagramSocket instead for UDP transport. java.io.StreamTokenizer(InputStream) As of JDK version 1.1, the preferred way to tokenize an input stream is to convert it into a character stream, for example:    Reader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
   StreamTokenizer st = new StreamTokenizer(r);
 java.lang.String(byte[], int) This method does not properly convert bytes into characters. As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the String constructors that take a Charset, charset name, or that use the platform's default charset. java.lang.String(byte[], int, int, int) This method does not properly convert bytes into characters. As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the String constructors that take a Charset, charset name, or that use the platform's default charset. org.omg.CORBA.TCKind(int) Do not use this constructor as this method should be private according to the OMG specification. Use TCKind.from_int(int) instead. java.sql.Time(int, int, int) Use the constructor that takes a milliseconds value in place of this constructor java.sql.Timestamp(int, int, int, int, int, int, int) instead use the constructor Timestamp(long millis) Deprecated Annotation Type Elements Annotation Type Element and Description javax.jws.HandlerChain.name As of JSR-181 2.0 with no replacement.
